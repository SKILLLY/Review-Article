            In the summer of 2018, I was walking near the campus of UC Berkeley when I turned a
            corner and came face-to-face with an irate robot.
            I didn’t know it was a robot at first. It looked like a cheerful microwave oven with big,
            knobbly tires, sitting smack in the middle of a busy urban sidewalk. It had a tiny blue
            flag on the end of a whippy little pole, positioned right at eye level — presumably to
            get the attention of distracted pedestrians like me.
            I had clearly disrupted its mission by stepping in front of it, and it wasn’t happy.
            Friendly digital eyes on its front morphed from a cheerful grin into a frustrated scowl
            as I stood there gaping and blocking its path. With some annoyed beeps, it turned its
            wheels, zipped around me in a surprisingly assertive way, and continued on with its
            day.

            I would later learn that the high-strung little blue and yellow box I had encountered
            was a delivery robot from a startup called Kiwi. At UC Berkeley and other college
            campuses, Kiwi has been testing its robots as an alternative to human food delivery
            drivers from companies like Uber Eats and DoorDash.
            When a student places a food order, the robots drive to selected restaurants, receive
            the order (which is stored in a locking compartment on the robot’s body), drive it to
            the student’s dorm or apartment, confirm their arrival via an app on the student’s
            phone, and unlock their compartment to complete the delivery.

            The robot I encountered was likely trying to bring some hungry student their burrito
            bowl, and I had momentarily interfered with this crucial mission — thus the angry
            beeps and digital eye roll. By the time of my encounter in 2018, the company had
            Kiwi has created a cool new tech and a clever business model for food delivery, which
            is becoming more crucial as Covid-19 reshapes the gig economy. And the company
            has managed to imbue its robots with the intelligence to navigate city streets and
            deal with irritating meat-space obstacles like myself.
            Kiwi’s robots appear to drive themselves and to operate autonomously. In reality,
            that’s partially an elaborate illusion.
            The robots come with cameras and computer vision driven by machine learning. They
            can detect and classify what they see, and tell the difference between a car, a person,
            or a wall.
            But they’re not totally autonomous, either. The robots are monitored and directed by
            remote workers in Colombia, who check in and provide guidance every 10 seconds.
            They’re paid around $2 per hour, a standard wage for the region.
